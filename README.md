# -- Updating Gallery Images --#

If you are adding images to the gallery, you can simply place them in the src/assets/team/gallery folder
but make sure you add an alt text to the manifest.json file in components/gallery referencing the filename

i.e.

"new_file" : {
    "alt": "your alt message"
}
